The phosphocholine headgroup of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) was deuterated at the two methylene segments. Phosphorus-31 and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance measurements were made as a function of hydration in the range of 10–70 wt.% H2O revealing a distinct change in the alignment of the phosphocholine headgroup. With decreasing hydration the N+ end of the phosphocholine head group dipole moves closer to the hydrocarbon layer. The conformational change induced by the loss of water molecules at the membrane surface is qualitatively similar to that observed upon addition of polyhydroxyl compounds."

abstract = "We recently reported the equilibrium maximum solubility of cholesterol in a lipid bilayer, χ*chol, to be 0.66 in four different phosphatidylcholines, and 0.51 in a phosphatidylethanolamine (Huang, J., J. T. Buboltz, and G. W. Feigenson. 1999. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. in press). Here we present a model of cholesterol-phospholipid mixing that explains these observed values of χ*chol. Monte Carlo simulations show that pairwise-additivity of nearest-neighbor interactions is inadequate to describe all the χ*chol values. Instead, if cholesterol multibody interactions are assigned highly unfavorable energy, then jumps occur in cholesterol chemical potential that lead to its precipitation from the bilayer. Cholesterol precipitation is most likely to occur near three discrete values of cholesterol mole fraction, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.67, which correspond to cholesterol/phospholipid mole ratios of 1/1, 4/3, and 2/1, respectively. At these solubility limits, where cholesterol chemical potential jumps, the cholesterol-phospholipid bilayer mixture forms highly regular lipid distributions in order to minimize cholesterol-cholesterol contacts. This treatment shows that dramatic structural and thermodynamic changes can occur at particular cholesterol mole fractions without any stoichiometric complex formation. The physical origin of the unfavorable cholesterol multibody interaction is explained by an “umbrella model”: in a bilayer, nonpolar cholesterol relies on polar phospholipid headgroup coverage to avoid the unfavorable free energy of cholesterol contact with water. Thus, at high cholesterol mole fraction, this unfavorable free energy, not any favorable cholesterol-phospholipid interaction, dominates the mixing behavior. This physical origin also explains the “cholesterol condensing effect” and the increase in acyl chain order parameter in cholesterol-phospholipid mixtures."

abstract = "We study the effect of cholesterol on the structure of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine phospholipid bilayers. Using extensive molecular dynamics computer simulations at atomistic resolution, we observe and quantify several structural changes upon increasing cholesterol content that are collectively known as the condensing effect: a thickening of the bilayer, an increase in lipid tail order, and a decrease in lateral area. We also observe a change in leaflet interdigitation and a lack thereof in the distributions of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine headgroup orientations. These results, obtained over a wide range of cholesterol mole fractions, are then used to calibrate the analysis of phospholipid properties in bilayers containing a single cholesterol molecule per leaflet, which we perform in a spatially resolved way. We find that a single cholesterol molecule affects phospholipids in its first and second solvation shells, which puts the range of this effective interaction to be on the order of 1–2 nm. We also observe a tendency of phospholipids to orient their polar headgroups toward the cholesterol, which provides additional support for the umbrella model of bilayer organization."

Using differential scanning calorimetry, it was determined that the phase transition temperatures (Tm values) of these PC species increased by 30–40 C° over the range of water contents between 20 wt% and 5 wt%. To determine the relevance of dehydration-induced phase transitions to membrane destabilization during freezing, the hydration characteristics of PC species were investigated by constructing desorption isotherms. For all the species, the water content decreased from an average 17 wt% to 4 wt% water over the range of water potentials from −16 MPa to −160 MPa. The results of these and related studies of mixtures of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-PC and dilinoleoyl-PC indicate that under the conditions of temperature and dehydration encountered during freezing and which result in membrane destabilization, unsaturated species of PC would be expected to remain in the liquid-crystalline phase."

ABSTRACT={The application of liposomes to assist drug delivery has already had a major impact on many biomedical areas. They have been shown to be beneficial for stabilizing therapeutic compounds, overcoming obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake, and improving biodistribution of compounds to target sites in vivo. This enables effective delivery of encapsulated compounds to target sites while minimizing systemic toxicity. Liposomes present as an attractive delivery system due to their flexible physicochemical and biophysical properties, which allow easy manipulation to address different delivery considerations. Despite considerable research in the last 50 years and the plethora of positive results in preclinical studies, the clinical translation of liposome assisted drug delivery platforms has progressed incrementally. In this review, we will discuss the advances in liposome assisted drug delivery, biological challenges that still remain, and current clinical and experimental use of liposomes for biomedical applications. The translational obstacles of liposomal technology will also be presented.}
