Project to investigate the dynamics of current lipid force fields

This project is initiated by H. Antila and M. Miettinen but we welcome anyone interested to participate. For publications arising from this project, the tentative author order is H. Antila first and M. Miettinen last, while others are placed in between. In case of significant contributions this is reconsidered in a fair manner.

Manuscript *Using open data to rapidly benchmark biomolecular simulations: Phospholipid conformational dynamics* has been accepted for publication in Journal of Chemical Information and Modelling, [preprint at bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.09.374850v2).
